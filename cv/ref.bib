  abstract={Introduction: Open-source software (OSS) is a critical component of open science, but contributions to the OSS ecosystem are systematically undervalued in the current academic system. The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) contributes to addressing this by providing a venue (that is itself free and diamond OA and all open-source, built in a layered structure using widely available elements/services of the scholarly publishing ecosystem) for publishing OSS, run in the style of open-source software itself. One element of JOSS is that it uses open peer review in a collaborative, iterative format, unlike most publishers. Additionally, all the parts of JOSS, from the reviews to the papers to the software that is the subject of the papers to the software that the journal runs, are open.

Background: We describe JOSS’s history and its peer review process using an editorial bot, and present statistics gathered from JOSS's public review history on GitHub showing an increasing number of peer reviewed papers each year. We discuss the new JOSSCast and use it as a data source to understand reasons why interviewed authors decided to publish in JOSS.

Discussion and Outlook: JOSS’s process differs significantly from traditional journals, which has impeded JOSS's inclusion in indexing services such as Web of Science. In turn, this discourages researchers within certain academic systems, such as Italy's, which emphasize the importance of Web of Science and/or Scopus indexing for grant applications and promotions. JOSS is a fully diamond open access journal with a cost of around US\$5 per paper for the 401 papers published in 2023. The scalability of running JOSS with volunteers and financing JOSS with grants and donations is discussed.}

  abstract={With density functional theory (DFT), it is possible to calculate the formation energy of charged point defects and in turn to predict a range of experimentally relevant quantities, such as defect concentrations, charge transition levels, or recombination rates. While prior efforts have led to marked improvements in the accuracy of such calculations, comparatively modest effort has been directed at quantifying their uncertainties. However, in the broader DFT research space, the development of Bayesian Error Estimation Functionals (BEEF) has enabled uncertainty quantification (UQ) for other properties. In this paper, we investigate the utility of BEEF as a tool for UQ of defect formation energies. We build a pipeline for propagating BEEF energies through a formation-energy calculation and test it on intrinsic defects in several materials systems spanning a variety of chemistries, bandgaps, and crystal structures, comparing to prior published results where available. We also assess the impact of aligning to a deep-level transition rather than to the VBM (valence band maximum). We observe negligible dependence of the estimated uncertainty upon a supercell size, though the relationship may be obfuscated by the fact that finite-size corrections cannot be computed separately for each member of the BEEF ensemble. Additionally, we find an increase in estimated uncertainty with respect to the absolute charge of a defect and the relaxation around the defect site without deep-level alignment, but this trend is absent when the alignment is applied. While further investigation is warranted, our results suggest that BEEF could be a useful method for UQ in defect calculations.}

These respective polymorphs exhibited thermal stability to ∼471–525 °C, ∼773–825 °C, and ∼490–575 °C before transforming into β-Ga2O3, across all tested ambient conditions. Particular crystallographic orientation relationships were observed before and after the phase transitions, i.e., (0001) α-Ga2O3 → (-201) β-Ga2O3, (001) κ(ε)-Ga2O3 → (310) and (-201) β-Ga2O3, and (100) γ-Ga2O3 → (100) β-Ga2O3. The phase transition of α-Ga2O3 to β-Ga2O3 resulted in catastrophic damage to the film and upheaval of the surface. The respective primary and possibly secondary causes of this damage are the +8.6\% volume expansion and the dual displacive and reconstructive transformations that occur during this transition. The κ(ε)- and γ-Ga2O3 films converted to β-Ga2O3 via singular reconstructive transformations with small changes in volume and unchanged surface microstructures.}

This has prompted an explosion in exploration of machine learning (ML) assisted techniques to improve the computational efficiency of DFT. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the broader application of Finetuna, an active learning framework to accelerate structural relaxation in DFT with prior information from Open Catalyst Project pretrained graph neural networks. We explore the challenges associated with out-of-domain systems: alcohol (C>2) on metal surfaces as larger adsorbates, metal oxides with spin polarization, and three-dimensional (3D) structures like zeolites and metal organic frameworks. By pre-training ML models on large datasets and fine-tuning the model along the simulation, we demonstrate the framework's ability to conduct relaxations with fewer DFT calculations. Depending on the similarity of the test systems to the training systems, a more conservative querying strategy is applied. Our best-performing Finetuna strategy reduces the number of DFT single-point calculations by 80\% for alcohols and 3D structures, and 42\% for oxide systems.}

But their commercial deployment as solar absorbers is currently limited by their intrinsic instability in the presence of humidity and their lead content. Guided by our theoretical predictions, we explored the potential of methylammonium bismuth iodide (MBI) as a solar absorber through detailed materials characterization. We synthesized phasepure MBI by solution and vapor processing. In contrast to MAPbX3, MBI is air stable, forming a surface layer that does not increase the recombination rate. We found that MBI luminesces at room temperature, with the vapor-processed films exhibiting superior photoluminescence (PL) decay times that are promising for photovoltaic applications. The thermodynamic, electronic, and structural features of MBI that are amenable to these properties are also present in other hybrid ternary bismuth halide compounds.

Analysis of whether current technology can scale, in an economically sustainable way, to sufficient levels to meet these targets has not yet been undertaken, nor have tools to perform this analysis been presented. Here, we use bottom-up cost modeling to predict cumulative capacity as a function of technological and economic variables and find that today’s technology falls short in two ways. Profits are too small relative to upfront factory costs to grow manufacturing capacity rapidly enough to meet climate targets, and cost is too high to generate enough demand to meet climate targets. We show that decreasing the capital intensity (capex) of PV manufacturing to increase manufacturing capacity and effectively reducing cost (e.g., through higher efficiency) to increase demand are the most effective and least risky ways to address these barriers to scale. We also assess the effects of variations in demand due to hard-to-predict factors, like public policy, on the necessary reductions in cost. Finally, we review examples of redundant technology pathways for crystalline silicon PV to achieve the necessary innovations in capex, performance, and price.}

  abstract = {Recently, there has been an explosive growth in research based on hybrid lead–halide perovskites for photovoltaics owing to rapid improvements in efficiency. The advent of these materials for solar applications has led to widespread interest in understanding the key enabling properties of these materials. This has resulted in renewed interest in related compounds and a search for materials that may replicate the defect-tolerant properties and long lifetimes of the hybrid lead-halide perovskites. Given the rapid pace of development of the field, the rises in efficiencies of these systems have outpaced the more basic understanding of these materials. Measuring or calculating the basic properties, such as crystal/electronic structure and composition, can be challenging because some of these materials have anisotropic structures, and/or are composed of both heavy metal cations and volatile, mobile, light elements. Some consequences are beam damage during characterization, composition change under vacuum, or compound effects, such as the alteration of the electronic structure through the influence of the substrate. These effects make it challenging to understand the basic properties integral to optoelectronic operation. Compounding these difficulties is the rapid pace with which the field progresses. This has created an ongoing need to continually evaluate best practices with respect to characterization and calculations, as well as to identify inconsistencies in reported values to determine if those inconsistencies are rooted in characterization methodology or materials synthesis. This article describes the difficulties in characterizing hybrid lead–halide perovskites and new materials and how these challenges may be overcome. The topic was discussed at a seminar at the 2015 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting & Exhibit. This article highlights the lessons learned from the seminar and the insights of some of the attendees, with reference to both recent literature and controlled experiments to illustrate the challenges discussed. The focus in this article is on crystallography, composition measurements, photoemission spectroscopy, and calculations on perovskites and new, related absorbers. We suggest how the reporting of the important artifacts could be streamlined between groups to ensure reproducibility as the field progresses.}

In this work, we reflect on the accuracy and prospects of these new design criteria through a combined experimental and theoretical approach. We construct a model to extract photoluminescence lifetimes of six of these candidate PV absorbers, including four (InI, SbSI, SbSeI, and BiOI) for which time-resolved photoluminescence has not been previously reported. The lifetimes of all six candidate materials exceed 1 ns, a threshold for promising early stage PV device performance. However, there are variations between these materials, and none achieve lifetimes as high as those of the hybrid lead−halide perovskites, suggesting that the heuristics for defect-tolerant semiconductors are incomplete. We explore this through firstprinciples point defect calculations and Shockley−Read−Hall recombination models to describe the variation between the measured materials. In light of these insights, we discuss the evolution of screening criteria for defect tolerance and high-performance PV materials.}

However, little is known about how charge-carrier lifetime and solar cell performance in LHPs are affected by extrinsic defects (i.e., impurities), including those that are common in manufacturing environments and known to introduce deep levels in other semiconductors. Here, we evaluate the tolerance of LHP solar cells to iron introduced via intentional contamination of the feedstock and examine the root causes of the resulting efficiency losses. We find that comparable efficiency losses occur in LHPs at feedstock iron concentrations approximately 100 times higher than those in p-type silicon devices. Photoluminescence measurements correlate iron concentration with nonradiative recombination, which we attribute to the presence of deep-level iron interstitials, as calculated from first-principles, as well as iron-rich particles detected by synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy. At moderate contamination levels, we witness prominent recovery of device efficiencies to near-baseline values after biasing at 1.4 V for 60 s in the dark. We theorize that this temporary effect arises from improved charge-carrier collection enhanced by electric fields strengthened from ion migration toward interfaces. Our results demonstrate that extrinsic defect tolerance contributes to high efficiencies in LHP solar cells, which inspires further investigation into potential large-scale manufacturing cost savings as well as the degree of overlap between intrinsic and extrinsic defect tolerance in LHPs and “perovskite-inspired” lead-free stable alternatives.}

Herein, one such compound is explored in detail through theory and experiment: bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). BiOI thin films are grown by chemical vapor transport and found to maintain the same tetragonal phase in ambient air for at least 197 d. The computations suggest BiOI to be tolerant to antisite and vacancy defects. All-inorganic solar cells (ITO|NiO x |BiOI|ZnO|Al) with negligible hysteresis and up to 80\% external quantum efficiency under select monochromatic excitation are demonstrated. The short-circuit current densities and power conversion efficiencies under AM 1.5G illumination are nearly double those of previously reported BiOI solar cells, as well as other bismuth halide and chalcohalide photovoltaics recently explored by many groups. Through a detailed loss analysis using optical characterization, photoemission spectroscopy, and device modeling, direction for future improvements in efficiency is provided. This work demonstrates that BiOI, previously considered to be a poor photocatalyst, is promising for photovoltaics.}

We experimentally determine bandgap magnitude and type, structure, carrier lifetime, exciton binding energy, film morphology, and photovoltaic device performance. We use density functional theory to compute the equilibrium structures, band structures, carrier effective masses, and phase stability diagrams. We find the A-site cation governs the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Cs3Sb2I9 has a 0D structure, the largest exciton binding energy (175±9 meV), an indirect bandgap, and in a solar cell, low photocurrent (0.13 mA·cm-2). Rb3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, a direct bandgap, and among materials investigated, the lowest exciton binding energy (101±6 meV) and highest photocurrent (1.67 mA·cm-2). K3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, intermediate exciton binding energies (129±9 meV), and intermediate photocurrents (0.41 mA·cm-2). Despite remarkably long lifetimes in all compounds (54, 9, and 30 ns for Cs-, Rb- and K-based materials, respectively), low photocurrents limit performance of all devices. We conclude that carrier collection is limited by large exciton binding energies (experimentally observed) and large carrier effective masses (calculated from density functional theory). The highest photocurrent and efficiency (0.76\%) were observed in the Rb-based compound with a direct bandgap, relatively lower exciton binding energy, and lower calculated electron effective mass. To reliably screen for candidate lead-free photovoltaic absorbers, we advise that faster and more accurate computational tools are needed to calculate exciton binding energies and effective masses.}

In this work, we introduce bayesim, a Python package that utilizes adaptive grid sampling to efficiently generate a probability distribution over multiple input parameters to a forward model using a collection of experimental measurements. We discuss the implementation choices made in the code, showcase two examples in photovoltaics, and discuss general prerequisites for the approach to apply to other systems.}

  abstract = {Defect-assisted recombination processes are critical to understand, as they frequently limit the photovoltaic (PV) device performance. However, the physical parameters governing these processes can be extremely challenging to measure, requiring specialized techniques and sample preparation. And yet the fact that they limit performance as measured by current–voltage (JV) characterization indicates that they must have some detectable signal in that measurement. In this work, we use numerical device models that explicitly account for these parameters alongside highthroughput JV measurements and Bayesian inference to construct probability distributions over recombination parameters, showing the ability to recover values consistent with previously reported literature measurements. The Bayesian approach enables easy incorporation of data and models from other sources; we demonstrate this with temperature dependence of carrier capture cross-sections. The ability to extract these fundamental physical parameters from standardized, automated measurements on completed devices is promising for both established industrial PV technologies and newer research-stage ones.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical kinetics at electrode–electrolyte interfaces limit the performance of devices including fuel cells and batteries. While the importance of moving beyond Butler–Volmer kinetics and incorporating the effect of electronic density of states of the electrode has been recognized, a unified framework that incorporates these aspects directly into electrochemical performance models is still lacking. In this work, we explicitly account for the density functional theory-calculated density of states numerically in calculating electrochemical reaction rates for a variety of electrode–electrolyte interfaces. We first show the utility of this for two cases related to Li metal electrodeposition and stripping on a Li surface and a Cu surface (anode-free configuration). The deviation in reaction rates is minor for cases with flat densities of states such as Li, but is significant for Cu due to nondispersive d-bands creating large variation. Finally, we consider a semiconducting case of a solid-electrolyte interphase consisting of LiF and Li2CO3 and note the importance of the Fermi level at the interface pinned by the redox reaction occurring there. We identify the asymmetry in reaction rates as a function of discharge/charge naturally within this approach.},

  abstract={Large-scale electrification is vital to addressing the climate crisis, but several scientific and technological challenges remain to fully electrify both the chemical industry and transportation. In both of these areas, new electrochemical materials will be critical, but their development currently relies heavily on human-time-intensive experimental trial and error and computationally expensive first-principles, mesoscale, and continuum simulations. We present an automated workflow, AutoMat, which accelerates these computational steps by introducing both automated input generation and management of simulations across scales from first principles to continuum device modeling. Furthermore, we show how to seamlessly integrate multi-fidelity predictions, such as machine learning surrogates or automated robotic experiments “in-the-loop.” The automated framework is implemented with design space search techniques to dramatically accelerate the overall materials discovery pipeline by implicitly learning design features that optimize device performance across several metrics. We discuss the benefits of AutoMat using examples in electrocatalysis and energy storage and highlight lessons learned.}

  journal = {The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters},
  abstract = {Accurate models of electrochemical kinetics at electrode–electrolyte interfaces are crucial to understanding the high-rate behavior of energy storage devices. Phase transformation of electrodes is typically treated under equilibrium thermodynamic conditions, while realistic operation is at finite rates. Analyzing phase transformations under nonequilibrium conditions requires integrating nonlinear electrochemical kinetic models with thermodynamic models. This had only previously been demonstrated for Butler–Volmer kinetics, where it can be done analytically. In this work, we develop a software package capable of the efficient numerical inversion of rate relationships for general kinetic models. We demonstrate building nonequilibrium phase maps, including for models such as Marcus–Hush–Chidsey that require computation of an integral, and also discuss the impact of a variety of assumptions and model parameters, particularly on high-rate phase behavior. Even for a fixed set of parameters, the magnitude of the critical current can vary by more than a factor of 2 among kinetic models.}
